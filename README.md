# Arduino Traffic Light Control System

**Description:**  
A traffic light control system implemented using Arduino for managing traffic at a two-lane intersection. This project features a pedestrian crossing system with two buttons that, when pressed, trigger a sequence that temporarily halts traffic on the respective lane to allow safe crossing. The system is designed to synchronize red, yellow, and green lights for both lanes, ensuring smooth traffic flow and pedestrian safety.

**Key Features:**
- **Two-Lane Traffic Light Control:** Manages traffic lights for two lanes with standard red, yellow, and green signals.
- **Pedestrian Crossing Buttons:** Allows pedestrians to safely cross by pressing a button, which interrupts the normal traffic light sequence.
- **Synchronized Light Timing:** Ensures that the lights are properly synchronized to prevent traffic collisions.
- **Arduino-Based Implementation:** Utilizes an Arduino microcontroller for managing input from the buttons and controlling the lights.

**Technologies Used:**
- Arduino
- C++ (Arduino IDE)
